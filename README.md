# Features

Hermes aims to deliever a robust group chat application experience where we aim to make online communication more seemless. It supports

- Creation of groups.
- Each group can be further divided into channels.
- A set of permissions are associated for every group. The subset of such permissions is what is defined as a 'role'.
- A user can be assigned one or more roles in a group. Such classification allows for much flexible permission management allowing for more proffessional communication.
- Like any other chat application, this application supports text in one-to-one and group communication.
